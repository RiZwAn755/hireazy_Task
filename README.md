# Hireazy Interview Simulation Room

## Tech Stack
- **React** (with Vite) for fast, modern frontend development
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first, responsive styling
- **JavaScript (JSX)** for component-based UI

## How the Solution Works
This is a simple two-user interview simulation app built entirely with frontend tools (no backend required). When you open the app:

1. **Role Selection:** You choose to be either the Interviewer or the Candidate.
2. **Start/End Interview:** You can start or end the interview session using the provided controls.
3. **Chat Functionality:** Both users can send and view text messages in a chat interface, with messages labeled by role.
4. **File Upload (Interviewer Only):** If you are the Interviewer, you can upload a PDF or TXT file. The file name is displayed in the UI (but not actually uploaded to a server).
5. **Minimal, Clean Design:** The UI is styled with TailwindCSS for a modern, clean look.

**Note:** Since this is a frontend-only demo, there is no real-time sync or backend. The app simulates a 1:1 interview experience on a single device/browser.

## What I'd Improve With More Time
- **Real 1:1 Experience:** Add a backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or Node.js) to enable real-time chat and file sharing between two users in different locations.
- **Authentication:** Allow users to log in and join interview rooms securely.
- **Persistent Storage:** Store chat history and uploaded files for later review.
- **Enhanced File Sharing:** Allow Candidates to view/download files uploaded by the Interviewer.
- **Video/Audio Support:** Add video or audio call features for a more realistic interview simulation.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Further optimize the UI for mobile devices.
